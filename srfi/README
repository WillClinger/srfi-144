This directory contains a portable sample implementation of SRFI 144.

The sample implementation should run without modification in every
complete implementation of R7RS (small) that uses IEEE-754 double or
single precision arithmetic for inexact reals.

To show how a Foreign Function Interface (FFI) to C99 math libraries
could be used to implement some procedures of SRFI 144, the sample
implementation is configured to use Larceny's FFI when running on an
x86 processor under Linux or MacOS X.  Although srfi/144.ffi.scm
uses Larceny's FFI to make many C functions available, the sample
implementation uses only three of those C functions:

    fma (to implement fl+*)
    jn  (to implement flfirst-bessel)
    yn  (to implement flsecond-bessel)

Those are the only C functions that provide a worthwhile advantage
in either accuracy or speed over the completely portable definitions,
as measured in Larceny.

The portable implementations of the Bessel functions are far less
accurate than the C functions jn and yn when the flonum argument is
on the order of 1e15.
